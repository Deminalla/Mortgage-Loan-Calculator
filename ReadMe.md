* the choice to see a line chart which compared linear and annuity payment types for each month


To compile with .jar, open Loan.jar in terminal and the write:
```
java --module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\openjfx-17.0.2_windows-x64_bin-sdk\javafx-sdk-17.0.2\lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar Loan.jar
